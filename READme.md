Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step:

1. First, we define a struct called `Board` to represent the Tic Tac Toe game board. It contains a `cells` array of size 9 to store the current state of the board. Each cell can have a value of `'X'`, `'O'`, or `' '` (empty).

2. The `Board` struct has several methods:
   - `new()` is a constructor that creates a new instance of the board with all cells initialized to empty.
   - `print()` prints the current state of the board.
   - `is_full()` checks if the board is full (i.e., all cells are occupied).
   - `make_move()` makes a move on the board by placing the player's symbol (either `'X'` or `'O'`) at the specified position. It performs validity checks and returns an error message if the move is invalid.
   - `has_winner()` checks if there is a winning combination on the board.

3. In the `main` function, we create a new instance of the `Board` struct and initialize the current player as `'X'`.

4. We enter a loop that continues until there is a winner or the board is full. Inside the loop:
   - The current state of the board is printed.
   - The current player is prompted to enter their move.
   - The user input is read, and if it is a valid number between 1 and 9, the move is made on the board.
   - If the move results in a win, the winning player is declared, and the loop is terminated.
   - If the board is full, indicating a tie, the game is declared as a tie, and the loop is terminated.
   - If the move is invalid, an error message is displayed.

5. Once the game is over, the program exits.

To play the game, each player takes turns entering their move by specifying a number between 1 and 9, corresponding to the position on the board. The game continues until there is a winner or a tie. The board is printed after each move to display the current state of the game.
